### Hello world, I'm Javi 👋
------------------------------------------------------------

I am **biotechnologist**🔬 with a Master's degree in **Environmental Agrobiology**🏞️🍁 who decided to jump into the coding world. I was a student at [𝟒𝟮 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/)💻, where I learnt how to code from scratch.

Nowadays, I am working in the Tragsatec Geographic Information Systems group, learning more about Spatial Analysis🌐, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)🗺️ and Data Science📊 to become an **Environmental Data Scientist**🌲🌸.
