------------------------------------------------------------

I am 🦠**biotechnologist**🔬 with a Master's degree in 🏞️🌾**Environmental Agrobiology**🌿🍁 who decided to jump into the coding world. I was a student at 💻**[𝟒𝟮 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/)**💻, where I learnt how to code from scratch.

Nowadays, I am trying to learn more about 🌍**Spatial Analysis**🌐, 🗺️**Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**📍 and 📊**Data Science**📈 to shift my focus and become an 🌲**Environmental Data Scientist**🌸.
