### Hello world, I'm Javi 👋
------------------------------------------------------------

I am **biotechnologist**🔬 with a Master's degree in **Environmental Agrobiology**🏞️🍁 who decided to jump into the coding world. I was a student at [𝟒𝟮 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/)💻, where I learnt how to code from scratch.

Nowadays, I am trying to learn more about **Spatial Analysis**🌐, **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**🗺️ and **Data Science**📊 to shift my focus and become an **Environmental Data Scientist**🌲🌸.
