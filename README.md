### Hello world, I'm Javi 👋
------------------------------------------------------------

I am 🦠**biotechnologist**🔬 with a Master's degree in 🏞️🍁**Environmental Agrobiology**🍂🌲 who decided to jump into the 💻**coding world**💻. I was a student at **[𝟒𝟮 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/)** where I learnt how to code using the *peer2peer* method.

Here I will upload the different projects I complete during my learning process, as well as some personal ones that I could develop during that time.
